In the 1950s and 1960s, the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence and the development of the first AI program, Logical Theorist, laid the foundation for AI research. The 1970s and 1980s saw the rise of expert systems, rule-based AI, and the development of machine learning algorithms. In the 1990s and 2000s, AI winter gave way to AI spring, driven by advances in computing power, data storage, and machine learning. The 2010s saw the emergence of deep learning, natural language processing, and the widespread adoption of AI in industries. Today, AI is a rapidly growing field, with applications in healthcare, finance, transportation, and more. "
