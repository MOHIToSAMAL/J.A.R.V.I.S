Here's a poem on nature:

**Nature's Symphony**

The sun rises high in the sky,
A fiery ball, that catches the eye,
The trees sway gently, in the morning breeze,
As nature awakens, with gentle ease.

The birds sing sweet melodies,
A chorus of joy, that echoes with ease,
The rustling leaves, the chirping sound,
A symphony, that's all around.

The mountains stand tall, with grandeur and might,
A testament to nature's, incredible sight,
The rivers flow, with waters so clear,
Reflecting the beauty, that's always near.

The stars appear, in the evening sky,
A twinkling show, that catches the eye,
The moon glows bright, with a gentle light,
 Illuminating all, in its sight.

Nature's beauty, is a gift to us all,
A treasure to cherish, and to enthrall,
So let's preserve, this precious earth,
For future generations, to give rebirth.
