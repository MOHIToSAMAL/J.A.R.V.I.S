Here's a poem on nature:

**Nature's Symphony**

The sun rises high in the sky,
Bringing light to the world, and a gentle sigh.
The trees sway gently, their leaves rustling free,
A soothing melody, for you and me.

The river flows, with waters clear and bright,
Reflecting the beauty, of the morning light.
The birds sing sweetly, their trills and chirps,
A chorus of joy, that never stops or slurps.

The mountains stand tall, with peaks so high,
A majestic grandeur, that touches the sky.
The wind whispers secrets, through the valleys below,
A gentle lover's caress, that only nature knows.

The stars appear, in the evening sky,
A twinkling canvas, that catches the eye.
The moon glows softly, with a silvery light,
A beacon in darkness, that guides through the night.

Nature's symphony, plays on and on,
A never-ending melody, that's been sung.
It's a harmony, of earth and sky and sea,
A beautiful orchestra, that's conducted by nature, wild and free.

So let's cherish and preserve, this gift so rare,
And protect the beauty, that's beyond compare.
For nature's symphony, is a treasure to see,
A precious legacy, that's been left for you and me.

I hope you enjoy it! Let me know if you need any modifications or have any specific requests.
